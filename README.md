# Angular-MatTable-Example
Spring Boot Angular Material Data Table Integrated Example with Data Table, Pagination, Sorting and Filter.

This example project is the result of my learning experience integrating SpringBoot and Angular Material Tables.  This extends a number of online examples by providing a datasource that supports a filter, paginator, sorting and the underlying SpringBoot service.

Spring Boot Notes:
- Version 2.2.0.RELEASE
- Extending JpaRepository interface.
- Filter searching across multiple columns of information.
- Spring Pageable
- Spring Page

Angular Notes:
- Angular 9.0.6
- Extending DataSource
- MatPaginator, MatSortAngular and MatTable

Note:  This is a proof of concept only and is provided as an example only.
